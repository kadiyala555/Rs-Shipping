<!-- STEP1 -->
<h3 id="step1"> üî∞ STEP 1: General Setup Instructions</h3>

1. **Generate a GITHUB TOKEN (We need this to get the Pull Request(PR) Information and publish reports back to Github PR)**
 * Go to your GITHUB Account (Not the Repo) 
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Settings ‚û°Ô∏è Then Scroll down to the end, Go to Developer Settings
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Go to Personal access token
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Generate a new token ‚û°Ô∏è Configure SSO 
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Copy the **token**.
 * ‚û°Ô∏è After you obtain GitHub Personal Access Token, Come to your **GitHub Repo**, 
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Click on Settings Tab ‚û°Ô∏è visit Security ‚û°Ô∏è Secrets ‚û°Ô∏è Actions, then 
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Add a secret and name it **GITHUB_TOKEN**  and in the value field paste the **token** you obtained from the above(1st) step

2. **Request SonarQube Team for access to a new project**
 * Access Request Instructions:
 * Identify a unique name of the project to be created in SonarQube [https://sonarqube.cloudapps.telus.com/] ex: cdo-triangulum-ctv for this app
 * This is where all your reports will be published
 * Also request for mapping your GitHub project in SonarQube [You should give the GitHub Repo Name to SonarQube Admins for mapping Repo with SonarQube Project]
 
3. **Once access is obtained to SonarQube ‚û°Ô∏è Go to Your name displayed on the left side Top corner**
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Then Click on My Account
 * ‚û°Ô∏è then go to Security
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Enter a meaningful name for the token ‚û°Ô∏è Click on Generate
 * ‚û°Ô∏è Copy/preserve the token [This is the token that enables authentication of your Github Workflow execution to publish results in SonarQube]

4. **After you obtain SonarQube Token...** 
* ‚û°Ô∏è Come to your GitHub Repo, Click on Settings Tab, visit Security
* ‚û°Ô∏è Secrets ‚û°Ô∏è Actions, then 
* ‚û°Ô∏è Add a secret and name it **SONAR_TOKEN** and in the value field paste the **token** obtained from the above(2nd) step

5. **Request Google Cloud COE Team for creation of Google Artifact Registry (This is needed for storing your Build artifacts)**
* ‚û°Ô∏è Identify a project name, Ex: trianngulum-ctv for this app
* ‚û°Ô∏è Identiy a location or obtain the location from the Google Cloud COE ex: us-central1 (if its across multi region, then you dont need this)
* ‚û°Ô∏è Identify a name for the repository and type (maven, gradle, docker etc). It is maven for this project and name is mockitodemoapp

<h3 id="step2"> üî∞ STEP 2: Maven Setup Instructions for Wiremock</h3>

1. **General Info**

WireMock is a library for stubbing and mocking web services. It constructs a HTTP server that we could connect to as we would to an actual web service. When a WireMock server is in action, we can set up expectations, call the service, and then verify its behaviors.
<p>Under Dependencies section in POM.XML, Add the below</p>

```XML
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
	    <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
	    <version>3.3.0</version><!--$NO-MVN-MAN-VER$-->
	    <scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>junit</groupId>
	    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
	    <version>4.4</version><!--$NO-MVN-MAN-VER$-->
	    <scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.tomakehurst</groupId>
	    <artifacId>wiremock-jre8</artifactId>
	    <version>2.33.1</version>
	    <scope>test</scope>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
```
2. **RestAssued, Junit and Surefire Reports are used along side Wiremock. Ensure the necessary dependencies and plugins are configured**
 
- [x] JUnit is used for Test Coverange
- [x] REST Assured is a powerful API testing library which makes the tests human readable and makes CI/CD setup a breeze
- [x] SureFire Reports are XMLs of the results of JUnit which can be pulished

3. **Post build, the artifacts has to be pushed to Google Artifact Repository(GAR)**

 * Developers commit and push changes to GitHub
 * The Workflow Engine is triggered when a pull request (PR) to develop a branch is made OR code is pushed to a develop branch PR
 * The Workflow Engine contains all the GitHub Actions automations which are handled via workflows
 * The gcloudbuild.yaml file contains the steps required for the workflow
 * The GitHub Actionsworkflow engine would build and spin up the docker containers
 * The Automated testing will be conducted by running through the test cases that were created
 * Once the workflow is completed, a comprehensive report is generated indicating the status of the build.

<h3 id="step3"> üî∞ STEP 3: GitHub Actions for Wiremock Project</h3>

**Below GitHub Actions will build and push the artifacts to GAR and publish the results and Pull Request(PR) Comments**
